# Credit Risk Classification

In this Challenge, I will use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on a loan risk. I will use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

* Split the data into Training and Testing Sets

* Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data

* Predict a Logistic Regression Model with Resampled Training Data

* Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report
